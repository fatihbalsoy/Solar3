SolarSystem.3js is a real-time 1:1 scale of the Solar System, including nearby stars, built with the [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) library. 

## [Launch â†’](https://fatih.balsoy.com/app/solar-system-3js)

## Gameplay

Scroll to move the camera closer or farther away from the planet.

Drag and click to orbit around the selected celestial object.

Center an object on the screen by pressing the following keys: 

* 0 - Sun
* 1 - Mercury
* 2 - Venus
* 3 - Earth
* 4 - Mars
* 5 - Jupiter
* 6 - Saturn
* 7 - Uranus
* 8 - Neptune
* 9 - Pluto
* c - Ceres
* m - Moon
* o - Polaris 
* p - Proxima Centauri
* r - Rigil Kentaurus

## Known Issues

Here are some known issues that will be worked on in the near future:

* Although the distance between stars is 1:1, the star sizes are extremely large for a visual aesthetic. A custom shader will be written to simulate accurate star sizes and brightness depending on their magnitude.
* The rotation of the solar system, milky way, and stars are all independent. Therefore, not accurate in relation to one another.

## Setup & Build
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run the following commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
