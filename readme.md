SolarSystem.3js is a stunningly realistic representation of the Solar System, complete with nearby stars, and brought to life through the power of [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/), [WebGL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGL), and [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react).

## Gameplay

To adjust the camera's distance, simply scroll up or down. If you want to orbit around a particular celestial object, click and drag your mouse. Additionally, you can center an object on your screen by using the search bar located at the top. For instance, you can search for celestial bodies such as the following:

<details>
<summary>Planets</summary>

* Sun
* Mercury
* Venus
* Earth
* Mars
* Jupiter
* Saturn
* Uranus
* Neptune
* Pluto

</details>

<details>
<summary>Dwarf Planets</summary>

* Pluto
* ~~Ceres~~ (Temporarily Removed)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Moons</summary>

Earth

* Moon

Jupiter

* Europa
* Ganymede
* Io
* Callisto

</details>

<details>
<summary>Stars</summary>

* Antares
* Polaris
* Proxima Centauri
* Rigil Kentaurus
* and lots more!

</details>

## Known Issues

Here are some known issues that will be worked on in the near future:

* The positioning of each celestial object is not entirely precise or accurate.
* The camera is not oriented along the ecliptic plane.
* The camera may not always accurately focus on a star.

## Setup & Build

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run the following commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install
