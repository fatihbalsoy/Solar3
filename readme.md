SolarSystem.3js is a real-time 1:1 scale of the Solar System, including nearby stars, built with the [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) library.

## Known Issues

Here are some known issues that will be worked on in the near future:

* Although the distance between stars is 1:1, the star sizes are extremely large for a visual aesthetic. A custom shader will be written to simulate accurate star sizes and brightness depending on their magnitude.
* The orientation of each celestial object is not yet accurate.
* The camera is not oriented along the ecliptic plane. 

## Setup & Build
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run the following commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run serve

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build:prod

# Calculate orbits and create cache file
npm run calculate-orbits
```
